- Kubernetes manifests and resource definitions
- Version control for infrastructure configurations
- Idempotent resource management
- Resource lifecycle management
- Declarative vs imperative approaches

### 2. DevOps Practices in Platform Engineering
Integration of DevOps methodologies within platform engineering contexts.

**Key Topics:**
- DevOps culture and practices in platform contexts
- Automation strategies for platform teams
- Collaboration between development and operations teams
- Shift-left practices implementation
- Infrastructure automation patterns
- Platform team responsibilities and workflows

### 3. Application Environments and Infrastructure Concepts
Understanding different environments and their infrastructure requirements.

**Key Topics:**
- Environment management (development, staging, production)
- Environment promotion strategies and workflows
- Infrastructure abstraction layers and patterns
- Resource isolation and multi-tenancy approaches
- Configuration management across environments
- Environment-specific considerations and constraints

### 4. Platform Architecture and Capabilities
Core architectural patterns and capabilities that define effective platforms.

**Key Topics:**
- Platform architecture design patterns
- Service-oriented architecture principles
- Microservices considerations in platform design
- API-first design principles and implementation
- Scalability and reliability architectural patterns
- Platform capabilities definition and exposure
- Integration patterns and service mesh concepts

### 5. Platform Engineering Goals, Objectives, and Approaches
Strategic understanding of what platform engineering aims to achieve and how.

**Key Topics:**
- Platform engineering objectives and success criteria
- Developer experience improvements and measurement
- Self-service capabilities design and implementation
- Platform adoption strategies and change management
- Business value proposition of platform engineering
- Platform team organization and operating models
- Golden paths and paved roads concepts

### 6. Continuous Integration Fundamentals
Core CI practices and their implementation in platform contexts.

**Key Topics:**
- CI pipeline design and architecture patterns
- Automated testing strategies and implementation
- Build automation and optimization techniques
- Artifact management and versioning strategies
- Integration testing approaches and tools
- Quality gates, checks, and approval processes
- CI pipeline monitoring and observability

### 7. Continuous Delivery and GitOps
Advanced delivery practices and GitOps methodologies.

**Key Topics:**
- CD pipeline patterns and deployment strategies
- GitOps principles, philosophy, and implementation
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling updates)
- Release management and coordination
- Git-based workflows and branching strategies
- Automated rollbacks and recovery mechanisms
- Configuration drift detection and remediation

*Study Tip: Focus on understanding the "why" behind platform engineering practices, not just the "how". The exam tests conceptual understanding as much as technical knowledge.*
