## In Progress

- [ ] Expanded Dagger pipeline examples (database agent, AI agent)
- [ ] MCP (Model Context Protocol) documentation and guides
- [ ] CNPA certification study materials

## Planned — Near Term

- [ ] **Hands-on tutorials** with step-by-step walkthroughs for each tool
- [ ] **Multi-cloud IaC examples** — AWS and GCP alongside existing Azure templates
- [ ] **GitOps guide** — ArgoCD and Flux setup with practical examples
- [ ] **Helm charts** — Curated collection for platform engineering workloads
- [ ] **Policy-as-Code guide** — OPA, Kyverno, and Cloud Custodian examples
- [ ] **Secrets management guide** — Vault, Sealed Secrets, External Secrets Operator

## Planned — Medium Term

- [ ] **Interactive workshops** — Guided labs usable in Codespaces
- [ ] **Platform maturity model** — Framework for assessing platform engineering maturity
- [ ] **Cost optimization guide** — FinOps practices for platform teams
- [ ] **Developer experience metrics** — Measuring platform success (DORA, SPACE, etc.)
- [ ] **Service mesh documentation** — Istio, Linkerd comparison and setup guides
- [ ] **VCluster guide** — Virtual Kubernetes clusters for multi-tenancy

## Planned — Longer Term

- [ ] **Case studies** — Real-world platform engineering implementations
- [ ] **Video content** — Walkthrough videos for complex topics
- [ ] **Assessment tool** — Interactive quiz to evaluate your platform engineering readiness
- [ ] **Template generator** — CLI tool to scaffold IaC and platform configurations
- [ ] **Multi-language support** — Translations for key documentation
