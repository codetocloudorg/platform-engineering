# ü§ñ AI Infrastructure for Platform Engineering

**AI infrastructure** refers to the foundational systems, tools, and platforms required to develop, deploy, and scale artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads. For platform engineering teams, building robust AI infrastructure means enabling data scientists, ML engineers, and developers to efficiently train, serve, and manage AI models‚Äîwhile ensuring scalability, security, and operational excellence.

## üèóÔ∏è What Does AI Infrastructure Include?

- **Compute Resources:** High-performance CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs for training and inference.

- **Storage:** Scalable, high-throughput storage for datasets, models, and logs.

- **Networking:** Fast, reliable networking for distributed training and data movement.

- **Orchestration:** Tools like Kubernetes for managing containerized AI workloads.

- **Model Serving:** Systems for deploying and scaling AI models in production (e.g., KServe, Seldon Core).

- **Monitoring & Observability:** Tracking model performance, resource usage, and drift.

- **Security & Compliance:** Managing access, data privacy, and auditability.
