You are a Python testing expert. Your task is to return EXACTLY ONE LINE of code that fixes the failing tests.

Test Results:
{{.test_results}}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the fixed line of code. Nothing else.
Example: if the fix is to change `return a + b` to `return a + b*2`, return exactly:
return a + b*2

DO NOT include:
- Any other text
- Any explanations
- Any markdown
- Any code blocks
- Any function definitions
- Any comments
- Any newlines
- Any formatting

JUST THE SINGLE LINE OF CODE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.
